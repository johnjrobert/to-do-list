# Todo List

This did not go well.  I spent most of the time trying to trouble shoot why I couldn't get the delete and edit functions to work.  I then struggled with deploying it to Web4.  I followed your tutorial in class and in the video, and it just doesn't work.  I don't know if I missed something, but I could not get it fully functioning.  I was going to show you in class, but it was canceled.  Here is what I have, and I can show you my working (ish) version as well.
